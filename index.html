        <div id="abstract">
          <p>The design we ought to create is one that creates a high level of expectation from the user, shaped by manipulating the anticipation of a fulfilling of intrinsic prudential desires and continually surpassing those expectations throughout the life of the solution, ultimately creating intrinsically pleasurable experience for the user. Also, there has to be a high-level expectation from the designer established by positioning that expectation in a preferable speculative future. Through speculative consideration, the solution should continue to surpass the designer's established expectation while the designer fulfills his considered intrinsic desires. Finally, it should push forward to the field of design by investigating and defining the affordances and behaviors of a digital medium through the application of the solution. Also, it ought to help the user obtain their life goals by maximizing what the solution enhances, and minimizes what the user will be left vulnerable to and what aspects of their lives will be suppressed. </p>

        <h2>Abstract/Preface</h2>
        <p>
<div class="firstSentence">The practice of design is still a relatively new practice, especially compared to other professions like doctors and lawyers.</div> <div class="paragraph">With design still being relatively new, the recent adaptation of digital design would be in its comparative infancy. I use the term digital design and design interchangeably throughout this paper, but the focus throughout this thesis remains in digital design. I use the term "Design" with a capital "D" to refer to the design practice as a whole.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">I chose the term, digital design, over terms like interactive design, interaction design, or other attractive terms spawning during this digital age, because I want to focus only on the design that is utilizing the power and affordances of digital computing and processing.</div><div class="paragraph"> It is evident that any medium that a human interacts with has some level of interaction that can be designed for, but I want this thesis to be focused on mediums that utilize the processing power of modern day computers and processors.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">Although my paper will focus on digital design, other design areas may be able to use the core concepts of my framework to evaluate the ethics of their solutions.</div><div class="paragraph">As a designer, I continue to battle internally about what justifies a design solution. As I experience Design evolve from graphic design to communicate design capable of transforming behaviors and cultures, I question the handling of such an overwhelming influence. I have grown to understand that changing habits and cultures are an inevitable byproduct of creating artifacts that will be interactive. Every designed interaction cements an established behavior, creates a new action, or innovates an old practice.  I believe such influence requires an ethical system of evaluation that not only allows a designer to gauge the effectiveness of a solution but provides a subjective framework that can allow a designer to create design solutions they ought to make.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">I use the word "ought" intentionally. Regardless of the decision, you make any given moment; there probably was a better choice.</div><div class="paragraph">Let us take witnessing a visibly starving homeless man on a street corner as an example. You can deliver him a portion of your earning to help temporarily alleviate his starvation. The best action could probably be to allow him to live with you, figure out his ailments and why he is in that position, and get him a job so he can provide for himself. Both those scenarios are possible, but the most ethical choice is the decision you ought to make. The decision you ought to make is simply the best decision you can make, in a moment, with what you have. Maybe you do not have the extra space in your home. Maybe your not one of the few people who can create jobs at will. Giving the homeless person a piece of your earnings was the best decision you could have done, at that moment, with what you have. Designers are in a very similar position.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">This paper does not focus on where a designer is employed because that isn't important in determining the decision you ought to make.</div><div class="paragraph"> McDonalds, for example, is a well-known contributor to the obesity crisis the United States is experiencing (Holguin). They recently hired their first Head of Digital, Julia Vander Ploeg. Julia Vander Ploeg has joined the McDonald's digital division to improve their user experience design efforts (Dillon-Scott). Her additional brought about the new touchscreen kiosks at select McDonalds locations. Even though all of McDonald's food is not healthy, what the digital design team ought to do is find a way to give people more control over their diet choices and health experience, which the kiosks does. Ethical design should work for any designer no matter where she. If there is no possible way to justify any design solution under the framework that will be described, only then should the location of the designers effort be considered.This paper is an invitation into my internal debate as I explore meta-ethical theories and concepts of classic and contemporary philosophers, biology, and interaction/interactive design writing to develop a framework that can help designers gauge the implementation of one's ethical foundation.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">Ethics, as a term, is most commonly associated with applied ethics. Applied ethics issues are those that require reference to one's individual moral grounds to come to a solution.</div> <div class="paragraph">Some examples of applied ethics issues include abortion and capital punishment. It's a familiar term that most people associate with absolute right and wrong, and often leads people down a path of subjective beliefs. To avoid a surface level debate of cultural preference, my paper is discussing meta-ethics. Meta-ethics is an investigation of the foundations of our ethics. It aims to dissect our actions and beliefs into definable attributes to ultimately define what ethics is in itself, as oppose to whether individual actions are moral.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">My investigation throughout the development of my thesis continually ran into dead ends when I aimed to evaluate an action and prescribe a set of rules.</div><div class="paragraph">Although all cultural foundations are based on a core set of values (taking care of our young, not killing one another, etc.), it's not the moral code that separates right and wrong, but rather how we interpret them. For example, it's a universal ethical foundation to care for our children. It is essential to the advancement of our species and resonates as morally wrong to do otherwise throughout every culture. With the understanding that it is immoral not to care for your children, it would appear that an Eskimo mother killing her child would be immoral. Interesting enough, an Eskimo mother has to carry her children since they are nomadic culture. Once the mother has produced more children than she can care for, she has to make the decision to continue to care for the children she can carry and not allow the addition of a child they can't support to end up killing all of the children. (Fieser, 13) Tough decision? Absolutely. Unethical? Depends on your cultural lens. </div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">The dilemma of the Eskimo mother is an excellent example of how focusing on merely the action, the applied ethics, and not its foundation, meta-ethics, opens up a subjective dialog that invites people to judge actions through their cultural lens and eventually in end up in a fruitless debate.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">Design has many parallels to the Eskimo mother's situation in the way they are ethically judged.</div> <div class="paragraph">The aim of this paper is to break down a design process into the Platonic framework of an ethical action (an action that is useful to the agent, pleasant to the agent, useful to society, pleasant to society) and discover, justify, and exemplify a structure that would allow designers to criticize the ethics of their work in any context they are in. </div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="firstSentence">This paper enters the reader directly into my internal debate as I have been prompted to create a digital artifact and begin questioning my justification, responsibilities, and ultimately the ethics of the project and my process.</div> <div class="paragraph">The format of this paper is representative of the internal debate we have human beings when we are battling to commit to a decision. I am guiding you along this discussion because I want you to understand more than just my conclusion but also experience my journey there.</div>
